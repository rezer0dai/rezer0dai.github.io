# Project REWheeler

Replay Buffer oriented!

## HER : request for research
### Floating n-step
### N-step GAE
### Conclusion

## Cross Algo Cooperation : PPO+DDPG
### Conclusion

## MROCS : multiple rewards
### Sparse rewards
### Conclusion

## RNN with goal
### Conclusion

## Noisy Networks Heads for Actors
### Conclusion

## Implementation and Features
### N-state
### Encoders
### CrossBuffer
### Seed-ed episode re-run
### Replay cleaning
### Online learning
Monte Carlo style
### Actor-Critic design
Encoders + Actor + Critic; Sync delta; Cliping gradients; advantages boost;
multiple critics;
### Algorithm Heads
### Task wrapper
Multi agents support

## What did not worked as expected
### Critics with different objective
Attention over them ~ though not tested on latest stages
### Good experience
Not tested properly, idea for LunarLander
### Curiosity PrioReplayBuff
TD-error is basically curiosity behind the scenes.
But also TD-error PrioReplayBuff i skiped for testing.
### PPO with CrossBuffer
Reanalyzing experiences
### Encoders double learning

### TODO
parerelism, replay buffer + HER + recalc rnn features all can be done on background, TD-error for ReplayBuffer and also as RewardBonus!

## Reacher environment UnityML
Why this env + intro; How i reconstructed reward and why; task wrapper; multi agents

## Jupyter notebooks
