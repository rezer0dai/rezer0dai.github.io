# Project REWheeler

Replay Buffer oriented!

## HER : request for research
### floating n-step
### n-step GAE
### conclusion

## Cross Algo Cooperation : PPO+DDPG
### conclusion

## MROCS : multiple rewards
### sparse rewards
### conclusion

## RNN with goal
### conclusion

## Noisy Networks Heads for Actors
### conclusion

## Implementation and Features
### n-state
### encoders
### crossbuffer
### good experience
### seed-ed episode re-run
### replay cleaning
### online learning
Monte Carlo style
### Actor-Critic design
Encoders + Actor + Critic; Sync delta; Cliping gradients; advantages boost;
multiple critics;
### Algorithm Heads
### Task wrapper
Multi agents support
### TODO
parerelism, replay buffer + HER + recalc rnn features all can be done on background

## Reacher environment UnityML
Why this env + intro; How i reconstructed reward and why; task wrapper; multi agents

## notebooks
